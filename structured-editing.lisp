;;; Implementation of structural editing commands for the Lisp syntax
;;; in Climacs. These commands were inspired by Paredit, which was
;;; originally written by Taylor "Riastradh" Campbell for GNU
;;; Emacs. In particular, many docstrings have been copied verbatim,
;;; then modified.

;;; This is a work in progress, be aware that problems are likely to
;;; arise, and that the editing commands are not yet completely
;;; comprehensive. Patches are, of course, welcome.

;;; You must do M-x Structedit Mode to enable these commands.
