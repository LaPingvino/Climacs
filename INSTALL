*Note*: Climacs depends on McCLIM, a graphic toolkit for Common Lisp
(http://www.cliki.net/McCLIM) and CLX, a low level, Xlib-like library
on top of which McCLIM is built (http://www.cliki.net/CLX). Make sure
these are properly installed on your system before attempting to install
Climacs.

Install instructions for Climacs.  We assume that if you have gotten
this far, it means that you have either extracted a tar file with
everything in it, or checked out the files from some CVS repository.

0. You need to check out the flexichain project from
   common-lisp.net. If you are not a member of those projects, here is
   how you do it:

    cvs -z3 -d :pserver:anonymous:anonymous@common-lisp.net:/project/flexichain/cvsroot co flexichain

   Ensure that asdf can find the .asd files for these projects. Recent
   versions of McCLIM depend on Flexichain, and thus, you might
   already have it installed.
      
1. Start Lisp either from the shell or from Emacs

2. (load "climacs.asd")

   This command will load the system definition file containing system
   definitions both for ASDF and for MK:DEFSYSTEM. 

3. (asdf:operate 'asdf:load-op :climacs)

   This command will compile and load the source files in the right
   order.

4. (climacs:climacs)

   Start the Climacs editor. Alternatively, try (climacs:climacs
   :new-process t), to start Climacs in a new thread.
 
Finally, please notice that as we develop Climacs, we occasionally
find bugs in McCLIM, or ask for functionality of McCLIM that can be
useful to us.

For that reason, Climacs often depends on very fresh CVS versions of
McCLIM.  If you discover a bug, please try to install a new version of
McCLIM before looking too hard for any other reasons.
