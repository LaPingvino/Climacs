Install instructions for Climacs.  We assume that if you have gotten
this far, it means that you have either extracted a tar file with
everything in it, or checked out the files from some CVS repository.
If your directory contains a Flexichain subdirectory, skip directly to
paragraph 1 below.  Otherwise start at paragraph 0.

0. You need to check out the Flexichain module from the Gsharp project
   on common-lisp.net.  If you are a member of that project, you can
   do this:  

    export CVS_RSH=ssh
    cvs -z3 -d :ext:<username>@common-lisp.net:/project/gsharp/cvsroot co Flexichain

   If you are not a member, here is how you do it:

    cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@common-lisp.net:/project/gsharp/cvsroot login
    <enter anonymous as password>
    cvs -z3 -d :pserver:anonymous@common-lisp.net:/project/gsharp/cvsroot co Flexichain
      
1. Start Lisp either from the shell or from Emacs

2. (load "climacs.asd")

   This command will load the system definition file containing system
   definitions both for ASDF and for MK:DEFSYSTEM. 

3. (asdf:operate 'asdf:load-op :climacs)

   This command will compile and load the source files in the right
   order.

4. (climacs-gui::climacs)

   Start the Climacs editor.
 
Finally, please notice that as we develop Climacs, we occasionally
find bugs in McCLIM, or ask for functionality of McCLIM that can be
useful to us.

For that reason, McCLIM often depend on very fresh CVS versions of
McCLIM.  If you discover a bug, please try to install a new version of
McCLIM before looking to hard for any other reasons.
