- modify standard-buffer to use obinseq with leafs containing
  flexichain-based lines

- implement a persistent buffer as a binseq of obinseqs (or similar,
  one sequence type for lines, the other for line contents), then
  upgrade it to an undoable buffer

- handle wrapped lines instead of making McCLIM handle them

- replace the use of the scroller pane by custom pane

- invoke redisplay after resize
