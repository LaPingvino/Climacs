Cyrus' Feature Requests/Bug Reports

- vertical scrolling

- fix horizontal scrolling such that the scrollbar can be used to move
  the point offscreen

- speaking of which, why have typeout panes at all? Or at least why
  not make them full-fledged climacs panes such that one can type in
  them, copy/paste, etc...?

- support M-Right and M-Left in structedit mode

- C-k at the end of a line breaks in structedit mode

- support cycling through possible choices for windows to switch to in
  C-x b

- allow for selecting among possibilities in a DEFINITION view

- allow for closing individual panes

- make tab (or double-tab) in M-x command entry pane show
  possibilities

- the choice of buffer for C-x b should be smarter

- weird flicker in creating/removing views (C-x 1, 2 or 3)

- delete region on really large regions is prohibitively slow
