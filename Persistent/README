This directory contains code with persistent data structures that are
primarily meant to be used for buffer implementation, but may also be
used as just balanced trees.

To use any of these buffer implementations (binseq-buffer or
obinseq-buffer), substitute "standard-buffer" in the superclass list
of climacs-buffer class in pane.lisp (marked by a "PB" comment). At
all other places marked with "PB" comments, substitute "standard" for
"persistent" in order to use the corresponding mark classes.

NOTE: There is a dependency of Persistent/persistent-buffer.lisp on
Flexichain/utilities.lisp (the weak pointer handling).

NOTE: Package :binseq is now used by package :climacs-buffer, and
the latter also exports persistent buffer and mark related symbols
mentioned above in connection to "PB" comments.
