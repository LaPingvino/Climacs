<li><h3> Description of the work to be accomplished: </h3> 

<p>Any sophisticated interactive application separates on the one hand
the module that manages application data (the buffer in the case of
Emacs) and on the other hand the graphical presentation of these
data.  In particular, one wishes to avoid calls from the module that
manages application data to presentation module.  In order to do that,
the presentation module must determine what part of the buffer to
present, so as to avoid displaying the entire buffer at each iteration
of the interaction loop.  One part of the project consists of
computing which part of the buffer to present.</p>

<p>A modern editor must be able to analyze the contents of the buffer
in a fairly advanced way.  If the buffer contains the text of some
program, the editor must possess some knowledge about the grammar of
the programming language in order to highlight parts of the code, to
be able to navigate by text unites defined by the programming
language, and to be able to compute desired indentation of the text
lines.  Another part of the project consists of implementing this
syntactic knowledge for a simplified version of Lisp, using a
syntactic analyzer of type Earley (which will be supplied).</p>

<br>
<li><h3> Required hardware and software:</h3>
<p>A PC with GNU/Linux.  A recent version (at least 0.8.17) of the
SBCL system (a free implementation of Common Lisp), GNU Emacs, SLIME 
(Superior Lisp Interaction Mode for Emacs), and possibly McCLIM.</p>
