<h1>Climacs, a modern version of the Emacs editor</h1>

<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>GNU Emacs is an excellent text editor, but was designed more than
20 years ago now, and the technical choices of the time create some
problems today. :</p>

<ul>
<li>Emacs Lisp is a language that was specially designed in order to
    implement Emacs.  Since the design of GNU Emacs and of Emacs Lisp,
    Common Lisp has been standardized, and gives both better
    performance than that of Emacs Lisp (because Emacs Lisp is
    implemented as an interpreter written in C) and more sophisticated
    functionalities (macros, CLOS, etc).  The natural choice for
    implementing Emacs today is thus Common Lisp.</li>

<li>GNU Emacs was designed before the existence of the Unicode
    standard.  Unfortunately, the internal representation of a buffer
    does not allow the representation of all Unicode characters in a
    compact way.  An internal representation allowing both all of
    Unicode and a compact representation for the ISO-latin-1 subset is
    desirable.</li>

<li>Twenty years ago, graphic user interfaces practically did not
    exist.  GNU Emacs was designed for a text-only terminal.  Today
    better modes of interaction exist. In particular, with CLIM
    (Common LIsp Interface Manager) it is both possible and desirable
    to have an interface based on the concept of "presentation types".</li>

<li>Because of the limited power of computers at the time, GNU Emacs
    uses a certain number of approximations in order to analyze the
    contents of a buffer, in particular when that contents is the text
    of a program.  These approximations are no longer necessary, and
    with current technology, it is possible to maintain a complete
    syntactic analysis of the buffer text. 

</ul>

<h2>Suggested projects</h2>

<p>The ultimate goal of the project being the replacement of GNU Emacs
with a modern version written entirely in Common Lisp, we propose a
certain number of student projects around this project, the
preliminary name of which is "Climacs" :</p>

<p>Here is a list of the suggested projects :</p>

<ul>
<li> <a href="buffer-en.html">An efficient implementation of a new
     protocol for representing the buffer of Emacs</a></li>
<li> <a href="undo-en.html">Implementation of a sophisticated "undo"
     protocol</a></li> 
<li> <a href="redisplay-en.html">Implementation of the redisplay
     module</a></li> 
</ul>
